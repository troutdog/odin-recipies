		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Lasagna also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,
		made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can refer to an Italian dish made of stacked 
		layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), 
		béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), 
		and seasonings and spices.[3] The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes 
		melted during baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and 
		then baked in an oven. The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square or 
		rectangular portions.

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>1 pound sweet italian sausage</li>
			<li>3/4 pound lean ground beef</li>
			<li>1/2 cup minced onions</li>
			<li>1 (28 ounce) can of crushed tomatoes</li>
			<li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans of tomato sauce</li>
			<li>2 (6 ounce) cans of tomato paste</li>
			<li>1/2 cup water</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons of white sugar</li>
			<li>4 teaspoons fresh parsley</li>
			<li>1.5 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
			<li>1.5 teaspoons salt</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon italian seasonings</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
			<li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
			<li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
			<li>16 ounces ricotta</li>
			<li>3/4 pound mozzarella, sliced</li>
			<li>3/4 cup grated parmesan</li>
			<li>One egg</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
			<li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
			<li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, 
			basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, 
			stirring occasionally.</li>
			<li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 
			minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
			<li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
			<li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles 
			lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 
			1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup 
			Parmesan cheese.</li>
			<li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent 
			sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
			<li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
			<li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
