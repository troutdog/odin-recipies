		<h2>Description</h2>
		
		<p>This salsa chicken recipe is very easy and quick! Someone gave me this recipe a few years back, 
		and it has become a household favorite. Depending on your taste, you can use mild, medium, or hot 
		salsa. I usually serve it with Spanish rice and Mexican-style canned corn.</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
			<li>4 teaspoons taco seasoning mix</li>
			<li>1 cup salsa</li>
			<li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons sour cream (Optional)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease 
				a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
			<li>Place chicken breasts in the prepared dish. Sprinkle seasoning mix on both sides of chicken breasts.</li>
			<li>Pour salsa on top.</li>
			<li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is tender and juicy and the juices run clear, 25 to 35 minutes.</li>
			<li>Sprinkle chicken evenly with cheese.</li>
			<li>Continue baking until cheese is melted and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes more.</li>
			<li>Top with sour cream and serve.</li>
		</ol>
